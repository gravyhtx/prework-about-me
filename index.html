      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Sah? I'm a chill braj that does has mad skills with graphic design + creative services</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>My mom... why who's asking?</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Making art, shredding it up on the guitar, and talking about how dope I am as a person</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Ok ok... for real. That would be working at a non-corporate design firm, with a focus on graphic design. If not tho... I'll be ok just being a straight baller.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>HTine [aka. Screwston, the Dirty South, Purple City, Clutch City] you know, in the Memorial Park area. Cuz I'm hard like that.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I know how to design (graphic, music video creative lead, product design, brand development), music [theory, performance (guitar, bass, drums,), production, mixing, mastering, live sound, and building/repairing analog instruments/pedals) among other real dope skills. I've build web pages, I have a basic understanding of html and css, but coding is my least dope skil so I'm trying to make that yet another dope skill to add to my resume. Also to get that piece of paper all the employers wanna see so I can stop having to freelance cuz that's some tough, thankless work. And plus girls love smart dudes so when I start talking code they'll know right away... <i> this dude dope!</i> </p>
